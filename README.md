# How to create a blog in PHP and MySQL database

I'm excited to be taking you through this long awaited tutorial, finally. I'll show you how to build a complete blog application from scratch using PHP and MySQL database. A blog as you know it is an application where some users (Admin users) can create, edit, update and publish articles to make them available in the public to read and maybe comment on. Users and the public can browse through a catalog of these articles and click to anyone to read more about the article and comment on them.
